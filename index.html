        Fourier frequency modulation is a prominent topic with critical applications in imaging, signal processing, and computation. Notably, significant advancements have been made in efficient Fourier frequency filtering for imaging, including edge detection. However, achieving tunability—where the filter can switch between different filtering targets—remains uncommon. Flat photonics, with its vast potential in reconfigurable photonics and optical modulation, has emerged as a promising solution to this challenge. This paper introduces a bilayer silicon 2D grating immersed with in UCF-liquid crystal first whose transform function can switch between the requirement of center blur and edge detection via electric-stimuli and gap tunning. To increase the polarization-insensitivity and isotropy, this paper also introduces a bilayer silicon metasurface featuring rhombus-arranged air holes, enabling a switch between 3D edge detection within a 0.1–0.5 NA and 360° azimuthal range, characterized by high polarization insensitivity and isotropy, and 1D center blurring and denoising through air-gap tuning.

The Fourier Filtering Metasurface works for modifying the Fourier of Input Image by suppressing or high-passing them, in order to achieve different filtering result. The Fourier of one Input polygon with its phase is shown in Figure 1.

      <p>
With an appropriate numerical aperture (NA), the Fourier transform of the input image is modulated interpolating the designed metasurface transfer function. After applying the inverse Fourier transform, the final filtered image is obtained with high precision. For edge detection, the central spatial frequency must be suppressed to an intensity level below 0.1; otherwise, certain central spatial frequencies may pass through the filter. Additionally, non-central spatial frequencies must be efficiently transmitted to maintain the device's overall efficiency. In contrast, center blur achieves the opposite effect by enhancing central spatial frequencies while suppressing others strongly. One critical question remains: how to clearly define the boundary between central and non-central spatial frequencies. Through extensive research and considering the device's limited working NA, this boundary needs to be as narrow as possible, meaning edge detection’s intensity needs to return and maintain as high-passing after a very narrow FOV. Center blur’s intensity needs to drop and maintain as zero-passing after a very narrow FOV. It is challenging to achieve the switch between these two within the same flat photonics device and working at same wavelength due to the strict requirements and limited of reconfigurable techniques.

Due to the simple mode of 2D grating, this paper initially focused on 2D Silicon Grating which enable such spectrum switching via gap tunning and UCF-liquid crystal electric-stimuli. It utilized one incident-angle insensitive dark resonance interacting with general cavity modes, shown in Figure 2

      <p>
      To address the limitations of 2D gratings in polarization sensitivity and anisotropy, rhombus-arranged air holes are incorporated into silicon bilayer slabs. Additionally, the tunability method is simplified by adjusting the air gap alone, eliminating the need for liquid crystals.
